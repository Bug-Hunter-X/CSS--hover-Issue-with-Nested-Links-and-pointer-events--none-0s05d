The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers.  The `:hover` pseudo-class applied to the `<a>` tag does not work as expected when the link is nested within a container with `pointer-events: none;`.

```css
.container {
  pointer-events: none;
}

.container a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
